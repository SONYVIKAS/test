1. Replace `def` with `public static`. This indicates that the function is a static method within a class.
2. Replace `return None` with `return null`. This is the equivalent of `None` in Java.
3. Replace `if not haystack or needle not in haystack:` with `if (haystack == null ||!haystack.contains(needle))`. This checks if the haystack is null or if the needle is not in the haystack.
4. Replace `if needle == haystack[0]:` with `if (needle.equals(haystack.get(0)))`. This checks if the needle is equal to the first element of the haystack.
5. Replace `count += 1 + recursive_index(needle, haystack[1:])` with `count += 1 + recursive_index(needle, haystack.subList(1, haystack.size()))`. This increments the count by 1 and then calls the recursive function with the sublist starting from the second element of the haystack.
6. Replace `return count` with `return count`. This returns the count as the index of the needle in the haystack.
7. Replace `if not haystack or needle not in haystack:` with `if (haystack == null ||!haystack.contains(needle))`. This checks if the haystack is null or if the needle is not in the haystack.
8. Replace `if needle == haystack[0]:` with `if (needle.equals(haystack.get(0)))`. This checks if the needle is equal to the first element of the haystack.
9. Replace `else:` with `else`. This indicates the start of the else block.
10. Replace `return 1 + recursive_index_2(needle, haystack[1:])` with `return 1 + recursive_index_2(needle, haystack.subList(1, haystack.size()))`. This calls the recursive function with the sublist starting from the second element of the haystack, and returns the result incremented by 1.
11. Replace `if not haystack or needle not in haystack:` with `if (haystack == null ||!haystack.contains(needle))`. This checks if the haystack is null or if the needle is not in the haystack.
12. Replace `if needle == haystack[0]:` with `if (needle.equals(haystack.get(0)))`. This checks if the needle is equal to the first element of the haystack.
13. Replace `else:` with `else`. This indicates the start of the else block.
14. Replace `return 1 + recursive_index_3(needle, haystack[1:])` with `return 1 + recursive_index_3(needle, haystack.subList(1, haystack.size()))`. This calls the recursive function with the sublist starting from the second element of the haystack, and returns the result incremented by 1.
15. Replace `def _recursive_index_3(needle, haystack, count):` with `private static int _recursive_index_3(String needle, List<String> haystack, int count)`. This defines a private static method _recursive_index_3 that takes three arguments: needle, haystack, and count.
16. Replace `if len(haystack) == count:` with `if (haystack.size() == count)`. This checks if the length of the haystack is equal to the count.
17. Replace `if needle == haystack[count]:` with `if (needle.equals(haystack.get(count)))`. This checks if the needle is equal to the element in the haystack at the given count.
18. Replace `return _recursive_index_3(needle, haystack, count+1)` with `return _recursive_index_3(needle, haystack, count + 1)`. This calls the recursive function with the count incremented by 1.
19. Replace `return count` with `return count`. This returns the count as the index of the needle in the haystack.
20. Replace `return _recursive_index_3(needle, haystack, 0)` with `return _recursive_index_3(needle, haystack, 0)`. This calls the recursive function with the initial count of 0.
