 2. The challenge requires implementing a binary search algorithm to find a given value within a specific range (1 to 100).
 3. The binary search algorithm works by dividing the search space in half and comparing the target value to the midpoint of the search space.
 4. If the target value is less than the midpoint, the algorithm recurses on the lower half of the search space, otherwise it recurses on the upper half.
 5. The algorithm terminates when the target value is found or the search space is exhausted.
 6. The challenge also requires measuring the number of guesses required to find the target value.
 7. To do this, the algorithm should keep track of the number of recursive calls made.
